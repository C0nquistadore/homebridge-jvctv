# Homebridge JVC TV
I created this plugin out of the private need, to turn my JVC TV on/off. I am using the model 'JVC LT-32V45LFC' which apparently offers a SmartCenter app to accept HTTP requests.

This isn't meant to be a full-fledged plugin to control JVC TVs.
Although only turning on/off is currently supported, this might be useful for others, therefore I created this public repository.
